Star IQ will have a search bar for anyone to quickly find any information they need, both for shopping and research. This will also allow users to search phrases or quotes from the Star Wars universe to find the direct information on where that was from, who said it, and items that correspond to those characters. It will also be placed on all pages of the website (following as you scroll) to ensure that the user always has easy access to it. Star IQ will also have a well in-depth story line that shows where each movie took place, when it took place, and who was within the story.
