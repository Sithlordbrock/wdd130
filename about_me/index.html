            Hello everyone! I am currently pursuing a BS degree in Applied Technology with 
            an emphasis in software deveopment and web applications! I love how all of BYU-I is online! I attended Utah State University for two years studying Computer Science
            and loved that as well! I currently love playing video games and spending all of my free time with my wife! My favorite video game right 
            now is Fortnite. I also really enjoy games like Mario Party and Super Mario Brothers!
        </p>

            My current job is a Loan Officer
            for Mountain America Credit Union. I really do love my job and the company I work for but I hope
            for one day to build into the mobile development team! As a Loan Officer I handel everything from 
            credit cards to mortgages! It has really helped me financially and has also allowed me to find my 
            passion through my school work!
        </p>

            I have only been a member of the church for about two years now. I was converted right after my 18th birthday and then was married only 
            one week later! My wife and I had the opportunity last year
            to get sealed in the Vernal Utah Temple! It has been such a blessing in our lives and I hope to continue to grow
            my love for the gospel while I attend BYU-I!
